# Data types are divided into two groups:
## Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
## Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)



# in java, there are two types of casting:
## widening casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
        byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
## narrowing casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
        double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
